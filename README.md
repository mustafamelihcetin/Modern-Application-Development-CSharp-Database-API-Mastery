## Introduction

This project set is a robust learning tool for mastering C# data management using various ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers), data management tools, and API integration techniques. With hands-on modules ranging from basic CRUD operations to advanced data analysis and API consumption, this project set provides a full-stack experience in C# data-centric application development.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Management**: Covers CRUD operations, joins, aggregations, and filtering across multiple data sources.
- **Advanced ORM Techniques**: Includes both Entity Framework (EF) and Dapper for high-performance data manipulation.
- **API Integration**: Develops RESTful APIs using ASP.NET and demonstrates API consumption, including authentication with JWT.
- **Multi-database Support**: Integrates with SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB to showcase different database management systems.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses chart controls and dynamic UI components for real-time data visualization.
- **JWT Authentication**: Implements secure user authentication and authorization with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Demonstrates async/await methods for scalable and efficient data access.
